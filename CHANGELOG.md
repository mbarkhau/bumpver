[gh_i181]: https://github.com/mbarkhau/bumpver/issues/181


## BumpVer 2022.1116

 - Fix: [incorrect version comparison when updating from vcs tag][gh_i174].

   When comparing the updated version to the latest vcs tag,
   an insufficient string comparison was used instead of
   comparing the parsed versions.

[gh_i174]: https://github.com/mbarkhau/bumpver/issues/174

Thank you to Timo Ludwig @timoludwig for this contribution.


## BumpVer 2022.1115

 - Fix: [use default date values][gh_i172].

   When parsing the current version, if it doesn't specify anyt
   date part, (such as is the case for e.g. SemVer), then use the
   current date to populate default parts.

   This enables updating YYYY patterns in copyright headers even
   for projects that don't use a CalVer pattern.

   Thank you [Benjamin Depardon (@bdepardo)][gh_bdepardo] for
   finding and reporting this issue.

## BumpVer 2020.1100-beta

Rename package and module from PyCalVer to BumpVer. This name change is due to confusion that this project is either Python specific, or only suitible for CalVer versioning schemes, neither of which is the case.

This release includes a new syntax for patterns.

```
version_pattern = "vYYYY0M.BUILD[-RELEASE]"             # new style
version_pattern = "v{year}{month}{build}{release}"      # old style

version_pattern = "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"                   # new style semver
version_pattern = "{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}"             # old style semver
```

The main reasons for this switch were:
- To enable optional parts using braces `[PART]`.
- To align the syntax with the conventions used on CalVer.org

The previous syntax will continue to be supported, but all documentation has been updated to primarily reference new style patterns.

- Switch main repo from gitlab to github.
- New [gitlab#7][gitlab_i7]: New style pattern syntax.
  - Better support for week numbers.
  - Better support for optional parts.
  - New: `BUILD` part now starts at `1000` instead of `0001` to avoid truncation of leading zeros.
  - New: Add `INC0` (0-based) and `INC1` (1-based) parts that do auto increment and rollover.
  - New: `MAJOR`/`MINOR`/`PATCH`/`INC` will roll over when a date part changes to their left.
- New [gitlab#2][gitlab_i2]: Added `grep` sub-command to help with debugging of patterns.
- New [gitlab#10][gitlab_i10]: `--pin-date` to keep date parts unchanged, and only increment non-date parts.
- New: Added `--date=<iso-date>` parameter to set explicit date (instead of current date).
- New: Added `--release-num` to increment the `alphaN`/`betaN`/`a0`/`b0`/etc. release number
- New: Added better error messages to debug regular expressions.
- New [gitlab#9][gitlab_i9]: Make commit message configurable.
- Fix [gitlab#12][gitlab_i12]: Error with sorting non-lexical version tags (e.g. SemVer).
- Fix [gitlab#11][gitlab_i11]: Show regexp when `--verbose` is used.
- Fix [gitlab#8][gitlab_i8]: `bumpver update` will now also push HEAD (previously only the tag itself was pushed).
- Fix: Disallow `--release=dev`. The semantics of a `dev` releases are different than for other release tags and further development would be required to support them correctly.
- Fix: Entries in `file_patterns` were ignored if there were multiple entries for the same file.

This release no longer includes the `pycalver.lexid` module, which has been moved into its own package: [pypi.org/project/lexid/](https://pypi.org/project/lexid/).
