# These dependencies are installed using:
#
#   conda install --channel conda-forge --name <env>
#
# Conda should be used for
#
# 1. Binary python packages (numpy, pandas, pillow).
#    The pypi may not always have binary packages for all platforms
#    and architectures you want to support. For example, pyblake2 only
#    has binary wheels for windows on pypi, whereas there are binary
#    packages on conda-forge (as of Sep 2018).
#    Binary wheels are becomming more common on the pypi this is
#    becomming, so this is less and less of an issue. Most of the time
#    it should be fine to add the dependency to pypi.txt instead.
#
# 2. Non python packages (nodejs, typescript).
#    Using conda for these kinds of dependencies minimizes
#    installation overhead for developers.

# BLAKE2 is a cryptographic hash function faster than MD5, SHA-1,
# SHA-2, and SHA-3, yet is at least as secure as the latest standard
# SHA-3. BLAKE2 has been adopted by many projects due to its high
# speed, security, and simplicity.
